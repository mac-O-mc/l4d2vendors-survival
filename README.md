# l4d2vendors-survival
spawns cool vendors that give stuff; no pickable weapons allowed

Although [a similar mutation exists](https://github.com/WaifuEnthusiast/left4dead2-vendor-mutation), both this and that project's vendors don't work similarly, nor do they use similar script code.

Even so, we both are aware of each other long before either of these projects started.
